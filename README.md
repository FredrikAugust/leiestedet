# Leiestedet

## Introduction

Leiestedet is a web service that aims to make it easier for people to loan out clothes in return for a small sum of money online. The website has an emphasis on simplicity, and aims to make the process as easy and painless as possible.

## Details

### Feature spec

The website will feature a lot of the same features as [finn](https://finn.no); the user posts a listing, and other users can contact the user with the contact information the poster provided. All transactions are done in person, removing the need for transactions online. This greatly reduces costs by requiring the developer to do far less, and the users are less susceptible to being scammed.
